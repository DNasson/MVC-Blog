The motivation behind this project is to creat a blog app that allows the user to see previous blogs that have been added, comments on the posts and then they are able to log in and create their own posts or comment.
I built this project to meet the need of a CMS-style blog. I wanted to utilize skills for the MVC ciricullum. 
I learned how to use handlebars and have them each pull in the parts they are responsible for. I learned more about routes and the correct way to add them so they will go where you want them to go. Puncuation is difficult and messes up my code far too often. 

## Installation

Open the github repository and click the green code button, copy the SSH code and git clone it in your terminal on the computer. 
Run "NPM i" followed by "NPM run start" to run the application
